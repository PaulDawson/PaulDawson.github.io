Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>
<p>I appreciate the informative post and pictures you have shared of different types of forklifts. This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks. The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>

<p>Scales - fork truck-mounted scales enable operators to efficiently weigh the pallets they handle without interrupting their workflow by travelling to a platform scale. These hand pallet trucks are equipped with a weight indicator or scale, which allows you to easily weigh loads during transport for maximum efficiency. Designed for light, medium and heavy-duty material handling, our internal combustion (IC) counterbalanced trucks are equipped with the unique Toyota System of Active Stability (Toyota SAS) to enhance operator safety and comfort.</p>
<p>Powerhouses like the Ford F-150 already command the road, but lifted trucks provide that extra level of customization that demand attention. Order picker trucks are another type of Class II electric motor narrow aisle truck. Rough terrain forklifts come in 2WD and 4WD variants; however, 4WD variant is the all-rounder that can accomplish all kinds of difficult tasks on rough terrain.</p>
