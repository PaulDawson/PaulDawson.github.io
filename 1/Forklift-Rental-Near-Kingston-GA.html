<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Some appreciate the appearance of the taller stance of these vehicles, while others like the enhanced view of the road from the extra ride height. For more information on what documentation you should have, both on site and in the office, see Rough Terrain Forklift Documentation” above. Though not quite as versatile as a skid steer loader, telehandlers and other rough terrain forklifts accept a number of attachments that boost both productivity and safety.</p>
