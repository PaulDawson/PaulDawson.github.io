As one of New England's top forklift distributors, NITCO maintains a huge new and used inventory of all the forklift types listed above.</p>
<p>It should be noted that you can equip your forklift with a camera to provide a pallet POV improve that view, though ask yourself this: Would you rather watch a football game on the 50-yard line, or on a 15-in.

<h3>Forklift Service Plainfield IL</h3>

If you want to be well equipped to take part in all the off-roading opportunities North Carolina has to offer, buying a lifted truck is the perfect solution. These lifts allow you to add beefier off-road tires and heavier suspension components but do come at a higher cost.</p>
<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts.

<h3>Industrial Forklifts Plainfield IL 60586</h3>
<p>If you are new to buying a forklift, carefully consider what type of forklift you need. Our expertise lies in a consultative approach to providing the best value-for-money forklift solution available to suit your needs. Double-deep trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks, and they are ideal for warehouses where a lot of pallet loads are stored in each bay.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
