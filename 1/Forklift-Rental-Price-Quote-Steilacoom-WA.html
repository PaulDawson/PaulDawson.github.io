<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Not only this, but a rough terrain forklift is comfortable and easy to service. A parking brake (or mechanism) shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser. Known for being highly versatile machines, these forklifts are capable of handling heavy loads from 2.5 tonnes up to 7 tonnes.</p>

If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be.
