These trucks are great for loading and unloading pallets and balanced materials, well as removing and transporting items from delivery vehicles. Sometimes, your business might require a lift truck that can handle rough terrain and work outdoors.</p>
<p>A 4,000 lbs forklift with a 500 lbs clamp can only add 3,500 more lbs of items. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity. According to U.S. government statistics, forklift-related accidents account for nearly 20,000 injuries and nearly 100 fatalities per year.</p>
