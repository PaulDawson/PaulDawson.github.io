An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>

The first reason is obvious Sun Equipment does not want you to purchase the wrong used forklift for sale or spend more than you need on a used forklift with features that you will never use.

<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>

Most rough terrain forklifts within this range are run by a single joystick that controls all boom functions and hydraulics for simple and efficient operation.</p>

<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class II powered industrial trucks. Long-term maintenance and upkeep on these lifted trucks can be higher than standard models, so keep that in mind when considering your options. We are also engaged in selling Second Hand or Used Forklift. All types of dockboards should have a high friction surface, designed to prevent employees or trucks from slipping.</p>
