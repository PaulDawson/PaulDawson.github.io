<p>Cumulative lift truck production in Japan reached 500,000 vehicles in 1985, and global cumulative lift truck production reached one million vehicles in August 1995. Ohio Power Tool is proud to be one of the exclusive distributors and repair facilities for Gray jacks and lifts. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
