<h2>What Is Forklift Working Mechanism & Where It Is Used Covington </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

The forklift experts at Northland Industrial Truck Co., better known throughout New England as NITCO , have hundreds of rental units on hand and are skilled at helping you figure out what options are right for your business. Long Term forklift rentals give you all the benefits of use with none of the risks of ownership.</p>
