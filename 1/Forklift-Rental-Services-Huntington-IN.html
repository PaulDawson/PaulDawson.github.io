<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. But as a general rule, most forklifts can take a multitude of different sizes and configurations. Rarely will you find a lifted truck that still has the stock tires on it. Larger off road tires are not designed to maximize road performance.

<p>We are offering a large range of Diesel Forklift Rental. Without a disruptive third mast, our wide-channel, dual-mast design gives the H Series forklift unmatched visibility. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts.</p>

A suspension lift is a modification to a vehicle to raise the ride height It is done for the purpose of improving the off road performance of SUVs or trucks and other off-road vehicles , or for cosmetic purposes. This type of forklift cannot be used for indoor applications.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
