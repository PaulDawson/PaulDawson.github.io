<h2>Truck Lift Union City</h2>
<p>This workshop is designed for participants who have little or no working knowledge of operating a counterbalance forklift. Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines. Also known as a large capacity forklift, the industrial forklift is essential for a warehouse with heavier loads.

The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment.
