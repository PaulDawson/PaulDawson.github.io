<p>Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. We've engineered the H Series forklifts to be the best at both.

Our hand pallet truck steering wheels in Nylon and PU are available in the markets with the customization facilities to cater to the ever changing needs of clients. You can get a lifted truck at home with a lift kit, have it done professionally, or buy a truck that is already lifted.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Linde reach trucks are equipped with such features as adjustable steering. These are just the most common types of forklift trucks. They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory. Reach truck - This one is a variant on a Rider Stacker forklift, designed for small aisles, usually Electrically Powered, named because the forks can extend to reach the load.</p>
