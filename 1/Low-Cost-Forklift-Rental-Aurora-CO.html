<p>Step area is 1.5 times larger with lower step height than fellow forklifts. The hydraulic pallet truck is very rigid, rugged and can take continuous heavy punishment in abusive Indian conditions. When looking at the forks, check for cracks, bends, and distortion that might have happened to due repeated overloading or ramming of loads.
