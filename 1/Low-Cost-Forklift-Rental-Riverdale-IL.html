<p>If you have ever ridden in, or driven a lowered truck, you are well aware of that lifted Super Duty coming up from behind with the headlights shining clear above your cab and lighting up the night sky ahead of you, as if you had a roof-mounted lightbar attached to your road grater. Suspension lift kits are completely different from body kits in terms of structure.</p>
<p>When leaving a powered industrial truck unattended, load engaging means shall be fully lowered, controls shall be neutralized, power shut off, brakes set, key of connector plug removed. One of the very nicely-designed pallet trucks to see is this Big Joe Pallet.
