Radnes Services Limited are London South's premier Caterpillar dealer offering the full range of material handling products to meet every requirement. The Company offers forklifts, lift trucks, dumpers, compactors, screeds, trowels, and telehandlers, as well as repairs and maintenance services.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>In the mid-1940s, producers started to make rough terrain forklifts. Moreover, the increasing effort from the end users to efficiently utilize supply chain will create demand for Pallet Trucks to handle large number of transaction expected to further increase in the coming years as well.

At the same time, reach trucks offer very high acceleration as well as impressive lift and reach speeds, which in turn ensures excellent throughput performance. There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>We bring forth our vast industrial experience and expertise in this business, instrumental in providing Forklift Truck. Rough terrain forklifts are used for areas that need the maximum amount of traction to transport inventory safely. To avoid accidents, the operator should always remember to stack the loads evenly across the pallet and that they are balanced. With no mast blocking the view ahead like on conventional forklifts, the Teletruk's unique side boom provides unrivalled forward visibility.</p>
<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions. For example a panto-graph reach forklift utilizes a scissor mechanism, allowing it to reach into racking with either a single or double reaching design. On the other hand, Europe is projected to witness significant growth in the global forklift trucks market.</p>
