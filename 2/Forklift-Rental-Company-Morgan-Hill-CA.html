<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails.

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities.

The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>Longer term rental equipment is better addressed with a charger that will need to be wired in at your site by a licensed electrician. The fall-arresting system must not interfere with the raising and lowering of the forklift platforms. Cat lift Trucks has developed two specialised order pickers to meet these needs. Guided very narrow aisle order picking truck - counterbalance type Order Picking Truck similar to the guided very narrow aisle truck, except that the operator and the controls which operate the machine are in a cage welded to the mast.</p>
