<p>Offering a cabin for all weather conditions, and with Toyota SAS as standard, our 8-Series engine powered forklifts are ideal for outdoor use. This program discusses common hazards presented by the operation of reach trucks and how to control those hazards through safe operating techniques. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
