At Bridgewater Chevrolet, we make sure when you get your lifted truck serviced, your alignment is checked, and a realignment is performed when necessary.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>

Suspension lift kits are completely different from body kits in terms of structure.</p>
<p>These machines are designed to work where the going gets rough, as their name implies. Hyster-Yale Materials is another such company that ha made a huge contribution to an increase in the global lift trucks market size. Adoption of forklifts for lifting various types of materials, such as steel, wood, and mortar, by the construction industry to transfer heavy goods and reduce mishandling is driving industry growth.</p>
