Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains. The operator stands in a sideways compartment and the side loader unloads objects on its side. When we start talking about lifting trucks, lift kits, etc.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors. Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
