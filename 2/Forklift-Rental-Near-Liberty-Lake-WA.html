In England a 40-cell unit has been used to drive a forklift truck and to do electric welding. When you see a sharp increase in production demand or need to supplement your core fleet, forklift rentals provide a cost-effective solution to keep production moving.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
