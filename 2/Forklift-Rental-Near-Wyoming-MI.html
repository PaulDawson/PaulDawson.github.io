A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability. The "HD" in name on many of these trucks stands for "heavy duty" which is expertly brought out in full force thanks to these lifts and customizations as well as their trim levels and available engines.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

The latest family of low level order picking trucks from Toyota Material Handling is the BT Optio L-series. We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>

A reach truck is a narrow-aisle, right-angle stacking truck designed for unit load handling with rack interface. 1,000 lb. loading capacity.
