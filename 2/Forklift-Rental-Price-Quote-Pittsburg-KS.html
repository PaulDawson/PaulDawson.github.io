Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet to optimise battery performance and shift life.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
