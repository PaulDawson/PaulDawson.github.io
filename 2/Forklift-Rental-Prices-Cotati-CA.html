<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items. Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift.

<p>A 4,000 lbs forklift with a 500 lbs clamp can only add 3,500 more lbs of items. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity. According to U.S. government statistics, forklift-related accidents account for nearly 20,000 injuries and nearly 100 fatalities per year.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>

Most rough terrain forklifts have safety glass paneling around the cab, too.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
