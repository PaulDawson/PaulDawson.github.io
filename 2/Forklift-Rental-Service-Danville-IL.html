In my region, paper mills call them tow motors,” warehouses may refer to them as stackers,” and builders tend to use telehandlers” in lieu of rough terrain forklifts.” OSHA uses the all-encompassing phrase powered industrial trucks,” or PITs, when referring to forklifts in its 1910.178 standard.</p>

They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.</p>
