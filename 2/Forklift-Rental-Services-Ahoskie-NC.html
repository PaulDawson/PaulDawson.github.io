<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Access Hire Australia have a range of rough terrain forklifts for hire to suit your needs including various operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions. One of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in material handling, the lift truck is a powered industrial vehicle used to lift and transport materials for short distances.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials.
