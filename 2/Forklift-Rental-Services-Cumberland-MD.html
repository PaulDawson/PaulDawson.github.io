<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<h3>Forklift Information Cumberland MD</h3>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts are most commonly used indoors in settings such as warehouses and retail spaces. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when load is raised to maximum lift height. Once you've found the right type of rough terrain forklift for your job site, the biggest decision you'll have to make is between renting and buying.</p>
<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Our exclusive ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers industry-leading lift, lower and travel speeds and easy-to-use ergonomic controls enhance operator comfort for greater productivity. A lifted vehicle becomes naturally top heavy, which causes it to be sensitive while cornering and braking. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
