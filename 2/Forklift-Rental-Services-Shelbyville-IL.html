The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>

Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed.
