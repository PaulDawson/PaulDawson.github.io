Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Gas-powered forklifts offer long service lives with relatively low maintenance costs. Efficient storage is an operational focus for many warehouse and industrial space owners and forklift trucks allow a company to make the most of their vertical storage capacity.
